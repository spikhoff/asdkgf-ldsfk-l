# Prime Distribution Study

This repository contains a study on the distribution of prime numbers and the Riemann zeta function.

## Description

The project includes the implementation of the Riemann zeta function for real values greater than 1, and visualizations of its behavior over a specified range of values. The code is written in Python and uses `numpy` and `matplotlib` for numerical computations and plotting.

## Files

- `main.py`: Contains the implementation of the Riemann zeta function and the code to plot its values.
- `test_main.py`: Contains unit tests for the `zeta` function.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following packages:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

You can install the required packages using pip:

```
pip install numpy matplotlib
```
